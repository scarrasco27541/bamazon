# bamazon

This simple app displays a list of inventory for a pet supply and car parts store, along with the price per unit and current availability of each item. Users are prompted to select (1) an item ID, followed by (2) a quantity. The program will tell them if they enter an invalid ID or ask for too many of the item. If the input is okay, the program will tally up the total, output the sum, and reduce the inventory for that item appropriately. This reduction will be visible the next time the program runs because it's is being saved in MySQL.
